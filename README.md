# Stock Market Insider Trading Game

## Overview

Long and long ago, there was a boardgame called "Market Madness", about
trading stocks with limited foreknowledge of what the market was about to do.
This project is a non-infringing remake of that game.

This project consists of the following:
* A set of generator scripts that build finished game assets when given
appropriate configuration files.
* A set of gamerule configuration files (in `common`).
* Sets of art assets (in subfolders of `assets`).
* Sets of layout hints for various print-on-demand game publishers and
physical game configurations (in subfolders of `layouts`).

The project is distributed under the license described in `LICENSE.md`.


## Art Asset Sets

The following art asset subfolders are provided:
* `placeholder` - Quick and dirty low-quality art intended for testing the
generator scripts.


**IMPORTANT** - In order to remain non-infringing, this project and
derivatives thereof may not contain any of the following:
* Text copied verbatim from the original game.
* Artwork identical to or derived from that used in the original game.
* Trademarked logos or phrases from the original game (including the name
of the game).

The rules of the game are not copyrightable; just the specific prose and
images describing the game rules and implementing the original version of the
game.


## Layout Sets

The following layout subfolders are provided:
* `gamecrafter-travel` - Small form-factor "travel edition" intended to be
made via the "The Game Crafter" print-on-demand service.
